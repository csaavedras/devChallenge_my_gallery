## Overview

![screenshot](./assets/screen.png)

Introduce your projects by taking a screenshot or a gif. Try to tell visitors a story about your project by answering:

- Where can I see your demo?
  We can see the complete result of the requested UI, based on Figma's designs, with a complete responsive experience.
- What was your experience?
  I had a good experience, I managed to solve the problem without much difficulty, it was developed only with HTML/CSS
- What have you learned/improved?
  In the challenge I spent more time solving the gallery of images, I decided to use CSS Grid to get the result of the design and review its key concepts.
